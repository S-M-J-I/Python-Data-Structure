# Python-Data-Structure
I will include basic data structures of python and how to operate with them. This is for my learning purpose so that if I forget something or wanna revise it, I can do that through thhese codes.
The goal is to summarize the use of basic data structures and depict their operations. 
These are Data Structure Codes from #CodeWithMosh Proper Documentation for clear understanding
